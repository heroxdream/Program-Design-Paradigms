Design Total:         27/34

Notes:
	- Style 
		- Use of magic constants like "("
	- Data Design 
		- expr-fn template incorrect: review the template recipe for mixed data
		- expr template should directly decompose add and mul in expr-fn
		- your template has one extra call in call graph
   		- shape of the functions doesnt match shape of the data defs
	- Function Specification 
		- Examples missing from most of the function 
		- expr->strings/layer: information about layer is missing in the purpose statement
		- integer->list : signature incorrect
		- expression->list : incorrect signature
		- integer->list : function name should be number->list	
		- function specification of expr->nelist-nelist-string - map function is missing
		- [X X -> X] should be any or should be a new itemized data
	- Implementation 
		- expr->strings/layer : implementation not matching the template
		- integer->list : whats the purpose of using local here
		- you are using accumulator but not using accumulator style in the functions

Notes:
Q: what kind of data?
A: itemized data
Q: what is it called when we have itemized+compound data?
A: couldnt answer
Q: what is mixed data?
A: couldnt answer
Q: template for nelist?
A: ans ok
Q: how do you know list-fn needs recursive call?
A: ans ok --- look at data def
Q: what's the purpose of an accumulator
A: ans ok context
Q: prefix-oneline-layout: is the signature correct? strategy?
A: said yes, but strategy should be data decomp
Q: what is difference between examples and tests?
A: couldnt ans

Presentation:
- required repeating of the question and lots of clarification and help
- dont interrupt partner when speaking
