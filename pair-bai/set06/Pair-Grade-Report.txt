Notes:

Data Design
* itemization template has to have one clause for each case in the data definition
  no exceptions

Implementation
* with a signature of Any -> Boolean, how do you know you can call first on the
  function's argument? (i.e. have-tag? shouldn't be doing this, rest-content-expr?
  shouldn't be doing this, rest-content-legal? shouldn't be doing this... you get
  the picture)
