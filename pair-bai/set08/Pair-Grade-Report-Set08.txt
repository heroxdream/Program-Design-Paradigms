Design Total:         28/34

Notes:

Function Specification
* lambdas need signature, purpose statemeng, etc. those are missing from
  strings->images
* signature for truncated-event-image doesn't match its purpose statement
* missing argument in string->images signature

Implementation
* lists don't always have a 'rest' -- how would your remove-last function remove
  the last from an empty ListOf<Username>?
* in render-message-area, usage of the truncated-event-image is hard to follow
* should've simplified text-color with a data definition that contains all of
  the acceptable Symbol types (and then used that in Event type)

Style
* a lot of your predicates are missing the ? at the end of the function name

Notes:

* you eventually saw how to simplify the examples in e.g. update-events
  but it took too much help

Notes:

* need to be more familiar with code you submit, it should've been very obvious
  that your check-type? function behaved identical to eq?
