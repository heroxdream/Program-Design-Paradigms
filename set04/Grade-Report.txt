Data Design:            4_/5
1. in worm what is a head, write a interpretation for that.
2. in template for worm, direction is missing


Function Specification: 4_/5
1. rearrange-segment: method signature is wrong

Implementation:         3_/5
1. in method eat-food->list  you are using (first list), since you never specified that
  it is a non empty list so chances can be list is empty so first of list will fail.
   follow the template.
2. in functions controlling direction such as turn-left you should not ignore right. here it should flip
  to opposite direction
Style:                 3 _/5
1. excedding 80 character per line 
2. if your worm is going in right direction then left key does not work
