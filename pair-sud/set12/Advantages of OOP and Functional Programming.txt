Advantages of Object Oriented programming:
1. Object oriented programming lets the user maintain the state of the object all the time. The object can be mutated as and when required.
2. It gives the flexibility of encapsulating the data and only the necessary parts of the program are available to the world. Abstraction is much easier with object oriented approach.
3. Code reusability increases as the classes can inherit the behavior of other classes.

Advantages of Functional programming:
1. Functional programming is useful when every data has to go through the same set of instructions and modules can be created in a more composite way.
2. As functional programming is composed purely of functions, modifying the output of the programming merely consists of changing the functions. 
3. The shape of the data determines the shape of the program. A program can be as complex or as simple as its data design.
